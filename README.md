# Discord with Tailwind

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npx create-react-app tailwind-discord`

Go hit the gym and renew the sense of energy, raise your dopamine, endorphin, and testosterone levels. When you are back, the app skeleton should be ready ;)

### We need tailwind

```
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss lint
```

### postcss as pre-processor

```
npm install -D postcss autoprefixer postcss-import postcss-nesting
```

Checkout the `postcss.config.js` file for configuration. Its simple!

### And react-icons

`npm install react-icons --save`

### And some react hooks

`npm install usehooks-ts --save`

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
